General notes on open questions from supervisor meeting:

## Why use mmap for the HNSW data? Why does LMDB use it? How does LMDB achieve atomicity/durability?

https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2022/cidr2022-p13-crotty.pdf - a good read on why it's an awful idea! LMDB uses it for a few reasons:
- it's just an on-disk B+ tree, zero-copy reads make read-heavy workloads super fast and generally the working set is small enough to fit in memory
- no need for a WAL, it uses copy-on-write and two 'meta-pages', and restricts itself to single write semantics. fsync is called on every write transaction commit, if fsync fails, the commit just fails and the transaction is aborted. the two meta-pages track the current state of the DB/pointer to current root node along with a txn-id, when you write you choose the older of the two meta-pages to write to. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcQ7g9ekaCo

For the HNSW data, the tradeoffs are a little more difficult to make. The working set is larger and data is more volatile, but the DX gain/codebase simplicity of using mmap might outweigh the potential performance costs as outlined in the paper. Perhaps as extension could build a WAL/buffer manager specifically for the HNSW slabs.

## Why not just use the filesystem as a database for graph data/storage engine instead of big slab files?

either way will need an in-memory index that maps vector IDs to vector data, placing vectors into large memory-mapped slabs is faster read-wise than relying on file IO with not much of a difference in code complexity (I believe!!)

## What does LMDB do for locking memory regions? Does it lock the entire memory region?

uses MVCC to avoid (reader) locking altogether, there are two different versions of the DB at any time and the single write multi-reader semantics makes life super easy, only need a file lock for the write transactions.

## Is OS paging really most efficient using mmap?

No not at all!! https://db.cs.cmu.edu/papers/2022/cidr2022-p13-crotty.pdf - see discussion above, as an extension could move away from it but it makes life easy in the short-term
